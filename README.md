##   facilating energy contract flows between producers and consumers

Here we simulate a simple environment where **Consumers**, **Producers**, communicate daily through a 
**Market** agent to book for their energy needs and pay.

The project involves creating a multi-agent system (MAS) using the JADE framework to simulate energy transactions within a grid environment. It comprises three main types of agents:

Producer Agents: Responsible for generating energy and advertising their production capabilities and prices to the marketplace.
Consumer Agents: Seek to purchase energy, evaluating options in the marketplace, and making booking requests based on their needs and the prices offered.
Marketplace Agent (Market): Acts as a mediator between producers and consumers, managing advertisements from producers and purchase requests from consumers to facilitate energy transactions.
The goal is to efficiently distribute energy from producers to consumers through the marketplace, optimizing for various factors such as price, demand, and supply.
